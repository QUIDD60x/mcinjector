# mcinjector
An old .jar injector I found.

This may not work anymore, or work at all for some. I'm using it simply to find exploits on older server versions (1.12 and below), and is supposed to be used to inject client side modifications (whether it be to bypass some client restriction or sneak behind a server "firewall").
